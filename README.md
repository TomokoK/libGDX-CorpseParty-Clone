# libGDX-CorpseParty-Clone

Map, sprite, and music assets are copyright Team GrisGris, 2011.

All other files (e.g. source code, voice acting, etc...) are copyrighted by the author (me).
Please contact me regarding any issues or questions.

Some assets have been ignored by git for privacy reasons. This will cause the project to fail on run if you attempt to build it yourself.

Project deadline: Late June 2018

Special thanks to #tiled and #libgdx on Freenode!

Refer to the TODO in DesktopLauncher.java for more information.
