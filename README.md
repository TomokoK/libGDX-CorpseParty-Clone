Voice acting audio has been ignored by git for privacy reasons. This will cause the project to fail on run if you attempt to build it yourself.
Remove the voice acting lines from Class1AScreen.java before building if you wish to run yourself.

Project deadline: Late June 2018

Special thanks to #tiled and #libgdx on Freenode!

Refer to the TODO in DesktopLauncher.java for more information.
